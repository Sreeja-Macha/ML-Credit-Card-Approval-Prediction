# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Importance

The `Credit Card Approval Prediction` is essential in the financial services industry, particularly within the banking and credit sectors, for accurately assessing applicant creditworthiness, minimizing default risks, and optimizing operational efficiency. It adds value by enabling faster, data-driven credit decisions, improving customer experience, expanding access to credit, and maintaining compliance. This approach not only safeguards financial stability but also provides a competitive edge in the market.

## Overview

This project aims to enhance credit card approval processes by applying advanced machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict applicant creditworthiness with greater accuracy. It attempts to address key challenges such as data imbalance through sophisticated techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN and Borderline-SMOTE and utilizes an observation window for more precise analysis, aiming to streamline decision-making and reduce default rates in the financial sector. The data has been sourced from Kaggle [Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/data).
